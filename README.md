COMP 580 Math Fighting Game for COMP 580 <br/>

Matthew Abernethy and Michael Qi <br/>

Welcome to MATH CRUNCHER 2000!
This is a math inspired fighting game that has been targeted to be accessible by those that are visually impaired. See how far you can make it through the various frightening monsters and math equations! You'll need to think carefully and be on your toes if you want to make it far. But watch out! If you take too long the monsters might win! Good luck, and I wish you the best on your adventure!

Each monster will ask you to solve either an addition, multiplication, subtraction, or division math problem. You can choose your answer with the mouse or cycle through the answer choices using the arrow keys. To submit your answer, click the left mouse button or press space bar on the answer of your choice!

When you answer a question correctly you will take health away from a monster, but if you answer incorrectly or if time runs out you lose health! The harder the difficulty, the less time you have to answer. When the monster has no health left you will go to the next level, but the monsters will get stronger each as you progress. If you run out of health, then it's game over! If you answer multiple questions right in a row, you get a combo multiplier and you deal double damage!

For those who have visual impairment, we utilize text-to-speech to read aloud each equation and answer choices as well as if you deal or take damage.
